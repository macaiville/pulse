            PULSE! <em>Your one stop shop for logging and keeping track of your workout progress.</em>

            My name is Jason Jones, a fellow gym goer. Every now and then, I found myself forgetting where I left off for workouts that haven't been done in awhile. This is what motivated me to create PULSE. Now setting new personal best or keeping track of every workout in the gym couldn't be easier. With a simple login, you can easily look back on your past progress and pick up from where you left off.
